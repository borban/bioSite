                <p>Welcome to the Bio site of Leidy!</p>
                <p>Leidy was born in Manizales, Colombia in South America and lived there until she
                    moved to the United States in 2017 to marry her fianc√©. Her native language is Spanish and she
                    learned English from both her schooling and in conversation with her boyfriend in the years prior
                    to coming to the United States.
                    During her time in Manizales, she lived with her Grandparents for many years when she
                    was younger and gained her love of animals from her Grandpa, who had many pets and enjoyed
                    caring for animals. Dancing was also something that was prevalent in both her family and
                    schooling as she grew up, which is why she loves to do Zumba every week.
                    Traveling has always been in her spirit and in addition to Panama and Curacao, she has
                    been all over the country of Colombia and the United States. These adventures are what satisfy
                    the thrill-seeking that makes her happy and is why she has indicated she wants to paraglide as
                    one of her bucket lists items.
                    Leidy is proud of the many accomplishments she has achieved so far throughout her life
                    and lists being a mother, getting her Bachelors, getting U.S. Citizenship, and spending time
                    hiking with her husband as the accomplishments and activities she has enjoyed most.</p>
